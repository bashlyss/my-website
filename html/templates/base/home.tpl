<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is James and I am a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science. In the past, I have spent my free time doing many things from stage managing 3 musicals to building this website to Netflix and many things beyond. Take a look at my interests page for more information.</p>
<p>Welcome to my personal website.  Please use the navigation bar to see some of my past coursework, read about my interests and explore movies I have watched.</p>
<p>Use the movie reviews link to view the newest feature.  Search and sort through movie results and view the rating I gave them.  Soon, short reviews will accompany as many as possible.  Send me an <a href="mailto:james.loewen@uwaterloo.ca">email</a> with suggestions for movies to add, new features or any comments related to my site.</p>

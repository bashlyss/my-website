<h3>Video Games</h3>
<p>I won't go too in depth here, but I have spent many hours playing a number of video games, typically binging on one for an extended period of time and then moving onto the next.  The various games I have spent the most time on are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Runescape - Web</li>
  <li>Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 - PC</li>
  <li>The Sims - PC</li>
  <li>Pharaoh - PC</li>
  <li>Mario Kart Double Dash - Gamecube</li>
  <li>Madden 06 - Gamecube</li>
  <li>Mario Party 6 - Gamecube</li>
  <li>Mario Kart Wii - Wii</li>
  <li>Realm of Empires - Facebook</li>
  <li>Clash of Clans - Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>These are generally the games I experienced the most success in, but I have played many others and am trying to slowly play fewer of as I find other ways to fill my time</p>

<h3>Chess</h3>
<p>From grade 4 through grade 12 I played chess regularly.  Over this time I played in many tournaments, winning a few and coming in second far more times than I care to count.  I entered high school as the top Grade 9 in the school board, or so I thought.  It turns out that someone who has become a close friend had gone to my high school after being in the catholic system in elementary school.  Entering high school as the top chess player in the school board in any grade and he proved that by not losing or drawing a single game in his high school career.  A few of which should have turned out differently.</p>
<p>This ignited my passion for chess as it was a game in which I could put my intellect up against another in a game of strategy, where chance doesn't determine the outcome.  I won the Grade 10 school board championship when my friend chose not to complete it due to other commitments, and graduated with a rating approaching 1500 at <a href="chess-math.org">chess-math</a>, at the time, among the top 50 in the province in my grade.  Considering I was almost entirely self taught, I consider this a relatively significant accomplishment.  Something that I have played less of the last few years as I have not had close friends to play with regularly, it is a game I hope to start playing again sometime soon when the opportunity arises.</p>

<h3>Cottage/Outdoors</h3>
<p>A significant number of my best memories are from time spent at a cottage on Lake Muskoka about a 4 hour drive from Toronto in the Canadian Shield.  It is a great place where I can relax, enjoy the outdoors and spend time out in the boat tubing or just exploring the lake.  I have not been able to visit Muskoka for a number of years, but have still found opportunities to visit other cottages and loved every opportunity I had to go to one.</p>
<p>The cottage is an escape for my family from the busyness of life and to spend time together playing board games, card games, relaxing on the dock, reading books, and generally recharging and having a great time before going back home.  One of my long term goals is to have a cottage in the Muskoka region that I am able to spend large portions of time at with my family.</p>

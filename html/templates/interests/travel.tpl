<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>Travel is one of my favourite things to do.  I have been lucky enough to be able to visit a number of different places already and I look forward to even more opportunitis as time progresses.</p>
<p>With my family I have had the opportunity to visit Bali in Indonesia where I first went white water rafting, got to ride an elephant and otherwise have an incredibly unique and life hanging experience.  This was my first international trip and fostered a travel bug.  I have since visited Peru where we went to Machu Picchu and climbed Wayna Picchu and visited other Incan ruins.  My family and I also visited Chile on the same trip where we stayed with a local family and I was able to visit local cities and experience the Chilean culture.</p>
<p>In my final year of high school, my drama class was given the choice to visit Ireland and I went to Europe for the first time with some of my closest friends.  My final trip outside of North America to date was to Costa Rica again with my family and my girlfriend where I went ziplining for the first time and went on the most intense white water rafting ride I have done.</p>
<p>I have done significant travel within North America, visiting Banff National Park, Drumheller, Alberta, Vancouver, Winnipeg numerous times, and many cities in the Northeastern US including Boston, Pittsburgh, New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Cedar Point, as well as places further south in North and South Carolina and Orlando, Florida.  I have also now had the opportunity to do two internships in Mountain View, California and visit Los Angeles</p>
<p>I hope to be able to travel regularly in the future and plan on travelling through Europe upon graduating from the University of Waterloo</p>

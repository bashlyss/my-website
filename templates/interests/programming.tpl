<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>I first took a programming class in Grade 10 which led me to find a way to channel my interest in math where I ended up writing a number of simple games ranging from Euchre to a simple platformer to Minesweeper, all written in Turing.  I then wrote Chess and Tetris graphical applications in C++.  My final major personal project I wrote in high school was a Maze game also in C++ that unfortunately has become unstable due to various complications resulting from operating systems changing and the graphics library I was using.</p>
<p>Since high school, I haven't done much personal coding and so the projects I have on my site are from my user interfaces class and this site itself.  I am starting development of an app with a good friend that will allow students at Conrad Grebel subscribe to find out when their' favourite meals are being served and receive notifications for them without needing to check a website regularly.</p>

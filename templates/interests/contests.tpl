<h3>Contests</h3>
<h4>Programming</h4>
<p>I was first introduced to programming in fall of my grade 10 year.  Within months I started competing in DWITE competitions with friends and others.  At the time I struggled with my lack of experience, but as I proceeded until my grade 11 year I started to attain some success, placing in the top 10 in multiple DWITE competitions, and Getting 48 out of 75 on the biggest of them all, the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC).  The grade 11 year finished with an appearance in the final round of the ECOO competition, a team programming competition held throughout Ontario at the school board, regional and then provincial level.  That combined with a top 3 finish in the Brock Computing Competition which is a contest for individuals held within the Niagara school board.</p>
<p>However, grades 10 and all were just the prelude to the biggest contests for me personally in grade 12.  Starting with more regular success in DWITE, but using it as a warm up for the big ones, I entered the year with lofty aspirations, qualify for round 2 of the CCC, reserved for the top 20 students across the country who get a chance to spend a week at the University of Waterloo and get the opportunity to represent the country at the IOI, the worldwide version of the contest.  I also wanted to place well at the provincial level of ECOO, ideally in the top 10 and compete for a podium finish, and win the Brock Contest.  Starting with CCC, I crushed 4 of the 5 problems within the first half of the contest giving me the other half to complete the last problem which was unfortunately too difficult for me to complete, but I was able to get a partial solution for.  The partial solution gave me just enough points to qualify in the top 20, only the second person in my school board to ever accomplish the feat.  ECOO was a fun one that year, staying 2 problems ahead for much of the contest, our team easily got through the first round.  The second round conflicted with a performance day for the musical I was stage managing, but I was able to attend anyway where we were fighting for first much of the day, but came up short with the last problem resulting in a 5th place finish which was nonetheless enough to make it to provincials.  In the provincials, I got stuck on the first problem and our team struggled to a finish in 18th place of about 25 teams.  Then came the Brock competition where I had to show to all the teachers there who knew I had qualified for round 2 of the CCC to see what I was truly capable of.  After crushing the first 3 problems in record time, just minutes ahead of one of my best friends the whole way, it came down to the 4th and final problem.  For the final problem, I chose a problem from the medium difficulty set, having already finished 2 of the 3 high difficulty problems and not trusting I would get the fourth done in time.  This problem was quite easy, resulting in very fast completion, but giving my friend about 15-20 minutes longer to complete the last hard problem.  As I found out later, he did go for it, thinking I would as well and that he needed it to have a chance, however he was not able to complete it during the contest resulting in my greatest contest win I had in high school, having almost 1.5 times more points than my friend who held on to second.  As of yet, I have not competed in a programming contest since.<p>
<h4>Math</h4>
<p>Math contests started for me in grade 6.  My first competition, Pythagoras, resulted in me placing top of the school, a feat I repeated in Grade 7 and fell just short of in grade 8.  I skipped contests in grade 9, but then in grade 10 I won the Waterloo multiple choice contest over a close friend who beat me on the long answer contest and on the Toronto contest earlier in the year.  Grade 11 I won the Toronto contest for the school and then proceeded to place second in both Waterloo contests.  Come the final year of high school, everything builds up to the Euclid, the biggest and most important contest for grade 12 students in Canada, especially those who are looking to attend the University of Waterloo.  My friend beat me in both the Toronto contest and a new Waterloo contest early in the year, leaving me 1 last opportunity to beat him in grade 12.  Come time for the Euclid, I was ready.  With 10 minutes left in the contest, he probably had me beat but I got a miracle solution to the last and hardest problem in the contest that I got most of the solution down for, giving me the top placement in the school by the margin 70 to 68.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed my contest participation for the many experiences it gave me during high school where I was academical focused but not challenged adequately in outside of the math and programming contests.  I have the contests to thank for much of my pursued interests in these fields and for keeping me interested in academics at a time when much of it bored me.</p>

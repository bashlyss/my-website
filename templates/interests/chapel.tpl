<h3>Chapel Committee</h3>
<p>One major interest of mine that has come on since I started attending University is my participation on the chapel committee at Conrad Grebel University College.  I was a member of it for 20 consecutive months from September 2013 until April 2015 when I had to leave temporarily as I was moving out of the Waterloo area for the summer.  During my time on the chapel committee, I have helped plan approximately 60 chapel services, participate in worship nights, led 3 bible study groups and have helped in making the chapel program more relevant to the larger community within the residence.  As time passes, I am looking to make an even more significant impact on the community chapel program, starting with some changes that discussions for will hopefully start this coming fall.</p>
